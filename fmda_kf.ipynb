        "The Kalman filter is at the foundation of many technologies in daily use, from GPS to weather forecasting. No model is completely accurate. Think space navigation: the movement of a Apollo 13 between the moon and the earth, subject to gravitational forces and propulsion, with the position ascertained by visual measurements. No matter how accurate the model of spacecraft motion is, the measurements are always burdened with noise. The idea of Kalman filter is to evolve a quantification of the of the state (here, positin and velocity of the spacecraft) in the form of a covariance matrix, and, using an estimate of the uncertainty of the data, adjust the state to split the difference every time measurements are taken. \n",

        "Here, we use the Kalman filter to estimate the evolution of fuel (dead wood) moisture content from a simple theoretical model, adjusting the state of the model hourly for measurements from fuel moisture a sensor in a wood stick exposed to the elements. This is needed for forecasting of wildfire progress; for this purpose, we also want to have the filter adjust the model from the data, so that it gives more accurate data for future when we only have hourly weather forecast but no actual data - because the future has not happened yet.

        "The Kalman filter provides an estimate $u$ of the time evolution of some unknown process, called \"nature\" or \"truth\". We do not know with certainty what the nature is, but we can observe it at regular intervals (steps) with some error. In each step, model $F$ advances the model state $u$ in time, $ u \\leftarrow F(u)$, and attempts to reconcile the state with an observation $d$ of the true state, so $u \\approx d$. The filter modifies the model state $u$ to balance the uncertainty in the model and the data (this is called *analysis*) and the cycle continues. For that purpose, the filter evolves also an estimate of the uncertainly of the model.\n",
