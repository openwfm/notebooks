    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are a type of timeseries model that relates the outcome at time $t$ to the outcome at previous times. Like other machine learning models, training is typically done by calculating the gradient of the output with respect to the weights, or parameters, of the model. With recursive or other type of autoregressive models, the gradient calculation at time $t$ ends up depending on the gradient at $t-1, t-2, ...,$ and to $t=0$. This ends up being computationally expensive, but more importantly can lead to \"vanishing\" or \"exploding\" gradient problems, where many gradients are multiplied together and either blow up or shrink. See LINK_TO_RECURSIVE_GRADIENT_LATEX for more info...\n",
    "\n",
    "RRNs and other timeseries neural network architectures* get around this issue by approximating the gradient in more stable ways. In addition to many model architecture and hyperparameter options, timeseries neural networks use two main ways of restructuring the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sequence Length:** The input data is divided into smaller collections of ordered events, known as sequences. When calculating the gradient with respect to the model weights, the gradient only looks back this number of timesteps. Also known as `timesteps`, `sequence_length`, or just \"sample\" in `tensorflow` functions and related literature. For a sequence length of 3, the unique sequences of length 3 are: `[1,2,3], [2,3,4], ..., [T-2, T-1, T]`, for a total number of sequences `T-timesteps+1`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Batch size:** Sequences are grouped together into batches. The batch size determines how many sequences the network processes in a single step of calculating loss and updating weights. Used as `batch_size` in `tensorflow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of batches is therefore determined from the total number of observations $T$ and the batch size. In a single batch, the loss is typically calculated for each sequence and then averaged to produce a single value. Then, the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters (weights and biases) is computed for each sequence in the batch. So each batch will have a single gradient calculation that is the sum of the gradients of each sequence in the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:* these same data principles apply to more complex versions of timeseries neural network layers, such as LSTM and GRU."

    "## Stateless vs Stateful Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs have a hidden state that represents the recurrent layer output at a previous time. There is a weight and bias at each RNN cell that determines the relative contribution of the previous output to the current output. When updating weights in RNNs, there are two main types of training scheme:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stateless:** the hidden state is reset to the initial state (often zero) at the start of each new sequence in a batch. So, the network treats each sequence independently, and no information is carried over in time between sequences. These models are simpler, but work better when time dependence is relatively short.\n",
    "* **Input Data Shape:** (`n_sequence`, `timesteps`, `features`), where `n_sequence` is total number of sequences (a function of total observed times `T` and the user choice of timesteps). The input data does NOT need to be structured with batch size in stateless RNNs.\n",
    "* **Tensorflow RNN Args:** for a stateless RNN, use the `input_shape` parameter, with `input_shape`=(`timesteps`, `features`). Then, `batch_size` can be declared in the fitting stage with `model.fit(X_train, batch_size = __)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Stateful:** the hidden states are carried over from one sequence to the next within a batch. Longer time dependencies can be learned in this way.\n",
    "* **Input Data Shape:** (`batch_size`, `timesteps`, `features`). In order for the hidden state to be passed between sequences, the input data must be formatted using the `batch_size` hyperparameter.\n",
    "* **Tensorflow RNN Args:** for a stateful RNN, use the `batch_input_shape` parameter, with `batch_input_shape`=(`batch_size`, `timesteps`, `features`)"

In this next example, we will use the same data from 3 locations as before, but we will stagger the start time of the sequences. This will result in losing a sequence at the end of the timeseries that are offset, so we filter out the data to match in dimensions."
