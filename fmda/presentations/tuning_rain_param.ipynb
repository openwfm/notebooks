    "\n",
    "Vanderkamp (2014) establish the following physics-based model of the affect of rain on fuels. The depth of a stick is modeled, and there is assumed to be radial symmetry and symmetry along the length of the stick. During rain, the outer layer of the stick absorbs the rain. The amount of absorbed rain $P_{abs}$, in units of $kg/s$, is calculated from the diamter of the stick $2r$ and the incident precipitation rate $P_{inc}$ (in units of $\\frac{kg}{sm^2}$):\n",

    "$P_{abs}=\\frac{2r}{P_{inc}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the moisture is limited to a max value $m_{max}$, which is \"determined through model calibration\". For 10-h fuels, they arrived on $m_{max}=76.8\\%$. This value was valibrated at a single study location."

    "The core of the physics-initiated model is an ODE built off of Mandel 2014. In the current version of the RNN (as of Jan 1 2024), the initiated model adds the effect of rain to the ODE moisture model. Call the ODE component of the model $f(m_t)$. So the modeled moisture at time $t=1$ would be the sum of the moisture model calculated on the previous timestep ($f(m_0)$) and a constant effect based on the rainfall. Let the following definitions for the model be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $S_{fm}$: scale parameter associated with fuel moisture. Currently (Jan 1 2014), this is calculated as the maximum observed fuel moisture value in the training data. Moving forward, this will be a hyperparameter.\n",
    "* $S_{rain}$: scale parameter associated with rain. As before, this is calculated as from the training data as the maximum observed rain (units of mm).\n",
    "* $R_t$: the observed rainfall data at time $t$ (units of mm)\n",
    "* $K$: the hyperparameter associated with rain. It is the percent increase in fuel moisture per mm of rain per hour, in units of percentage of fuel moisture per hour millimeter $\\frac{\\%}{h\\cdot mm}$ (??? Get Jan to Confirm)\n",
