The testing data lives in testing_dict.pickle

To create this file,

    1. Run presentations/fmda_kf_orig. Note hash of RNN models

       final weights hash: 6.097204094384783e+19

       final model hash: 135047939437355302

    2. Run data/create_test_dict

    3. Run rmda_rnn_rain, hash of RNN models should match
